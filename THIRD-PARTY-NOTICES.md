# Third-party notices

This repository contains this project's own work and, in `loader-changes/`, changes to other
people's software. The built programs (`LemonPatch.exe` and the loader package `melon_data.zip`) are
not stored here since 2026-10-17: `patcher/1 - patch.bat` downloads them into `patcher/tool/` from
[the commit of the old Android repository where they were published](https://github.com/silentanarchist/wf-revival-mod-android/tree/52b333dd265cbee4471db22bfe140d95e99754c5/patcher/tool),
and everything below applies to them as it did there. This file says what is whose, under which licence,
and what was changed. The licence texts are in [`licenses/`](licenses).

## This project's own work: MIT

The mod (`WarpforgeRevival/`, `WarpforgeRevival.Android/`), the scripts in `patcher/` and the
documentation are under the MIT licence in [LICENSE](LICENSE). That licence covers this project's
own work only. It does not cover the game, and it does not replace the licences below.

## Changed software

Each of these was changed by this project in October 2026. The complete changed source of each
is published as the `warpforge-revival` branch of this project's fork of it, and the changes
alone are also here as diffs.

| What | Where it is here | Licence | Complete source (fork), and what it is based on | Changes alone |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **MelonLoader**, LemonLoader's Android port. Copyright 2020 - 2022 Lava Gang; Android port by the LemonLoader team. | Built into `patcher/tool/melon_data.zip` (`MelonLoader/`, `native/libmain.so`) | Apache-2.0 ([text](licenses/Apache-2.0.txt), [NOTICE](licenses/MelonLoader-NOTICE.txt)) | <https://github.com/silentanarchist/MelonLoader/tree/warpforge-revival> (`2e075e7f2407`), based on <https://github.com/LemonLoader/MelonLoader> branch `0.7.0` at `7b14dac3281fe9a88a1b8f0c96f5b9a46f558cdf` | [`loader-changes/melonloader-lemonloader-0.7.diff`](loader-changes/melonloader-lemonloader-0.7.diff) |
| **Il2CppInterop** (ARM64). By knah, BepInEx and contributors; ARM64 version by the LemonLoader team. | Built into `patcher/tool/melon_data.zip` (`MelonLoader/net6/Il2CppInterop.*.dll`) | LGPL-3.0 ([text](licenses/LGPL-3.0.txt), which adds to [GPL-3.0](licenses/GPL-3.0.txt)) | <https://github.com/silentanarchist/Il2CppInteropARM64/tree/warpforge-revival> (`abb023d18096`), based on <https://github.com/LemonLoader/Il2CppInteropARM64> master at `a60ebf5` plus six fixes from <https://github.com/BepInEx/Il2CppInterop> (together `f194da048db229ca6e649494095f9c9d3fce4e31`, in the fork) | [`loader-changes/il2cppinterop-arm64.diff`](loader-changes/il2cppinterop-arm64.diff) |
| **MelonLoader Installer** (LemonLoader). The patching program `LemonPatch.exe` is its patching code with a command-line front end. | `patcher/tool/LemonPatch.exe` (downloaded as `.part0`/`.part1`) | GPL-3.0 ([text](licenses/GPL-3.0.txt)) | <https://github.com/silentanarchist/MelonLoaderInstaller/tree/warpforge-revival> (`94f7a5ffbce5`), based on <https://github.com/LemonLoader/MelonLoaderInstaller> at `ac443fce9f2ef890caddf8c64bba9194a43361bd` | [`patcher/LemonPatch-core-change.diff`](patcher/LemonPatch-core-change.diff), [`patcher/LemonPatch-source.cs`](patcher/LemonPatch-source.cs), [`patcher/LemonPatch.csproj`](patcher/LemonPatch.csproj) |

`LemonPatch.exe` as a whole, including this project's front end and changes to it, is offered
under GPL-3.0. The changed Il2CppInterop libraries are offered under LGPL-3.0, and the changed
MelonLoader under Apache-2.0. How to rebuild each from source is in [docs/android.md](docs/android.md) under "Building".

If a fork above ever stops being available, open an issue here and the complete source of that
component will be published in this repository.

## Unchanged software inside the loader package

`patcher/tool/melon_data.zip` also carries these, unchanged, as MelonLoader ships them. The
package keeps MelonLoader's own notices in `MelonLoader/Documentation/` and the .NET runtime's in
`dotnet/LICENSE.txt` and `dotnet/ThirdPartyNotices.txt`.

## Not covered by any licence here

- **The game.** Nothing in this repository gives any right to *Warhammer 40,000: Warpforge*, its
  files or its artwork. You need your own copy.
- **Interface files** in the loader package (`MelonLoader/Il2CppAssemblies`) are generated from
  the game by the tools above and describe the game's classes by name; see the README.
- **Unity engine libraries** among those files contain Unity Technologies' own library code, as
  every MelonLoader installation produces. They remain Unity's.
